Should I submit it as shared task report or full paper? Yes

But I should try to submit a wit.ai chatbot

According to [instructions](http://workshop.colips.org/wochat/cfps.html)
I downloaded LNCS template from https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0

The Overleaf corresponding project is:
