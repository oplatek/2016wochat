\begin{abstract}
    This paper presents a novel datasets for for training end-to-end task oriented conversational agents.
    The dataset contains task oriented conversation between an operator, a task expert, and a client who is seeking information about the task along with records of data base API calls of the operator, which capture the distilled meaning of the user query.
    The data base calls represent not only instantiation of user wishes but also, when evaluated against the database determine the answer from the database, which were used by the operator to provide requested information to the client. 
    We expect that this additional supervision of recording database interaction will provide enough information so the task of the conversation can be understood and behaviour of the interlocutors reconstructed by software agents.
    The dataset was collected using crowdsourcing in offline setting, where each contributor played role either of an operator or a client and contributed single utterance.
    The quality of the data were enforced by mutual control among contributors and manually verified on random sub-sample.
    The dataset is available for download under the Creative Commons 4.0 BY-SA license.
